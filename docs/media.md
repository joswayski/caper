# Public voice-channel MVP

## Scope and architecture

One public **General voice channel**, always available to join while the service
is enabled. This is not a dial/invite/call flow. No accounts, text chat,
camera, screen sharing, channel creation, or recording by Caper. Faker generates
an adjective/animal nickname once per explicit join in the browser; the Rust
registry stores it and distributes the same name to every participant. Automatic
reconnect keeps the nickname; explicit leave/join generates another. The lobby
does not persist presence. Names can collide or be impersonated; participant
IDs, not names, distinguish people. Up to 12 people can join with microphone permission,
mute, deafen, choose devices, and leave. Other visitors may record audio.

Browser → same-origin `/api/media/*` → single Rust Axum service → Cloudflare
control API. Browser ↔ Cloudflare Realtime SFU/TURN for WebRTC audio. No media
relays through AWS, Workers, Durable Objects, RealtimeKit or PlanetScale.
Three-second HTTP snapshots provide presence/heartbeat; no WebSocket is needed.

The website has two AWS k3s replicas. A separate **single-replica** Rust service
owns the in-memory participant registry. Do not scale that registry or use sticky
sessions as a substitute for shared coordination. Restarting the service clears
presence and clients rejoin. Each tab receives an unguessable short-lived device
capability, not an account/login. Clients use Caper track IDs, not arbitrary SFU
session IDs. Cloudflare terminates transport encryption; this is **not E2EE**.

## Provisioned resources and configuration

On September 6, 2026, the owner authorized Cloudflare provisioning. Created in
the connected Cloudflare account:

- Realtime SFU app `caper-voice-mvp`: `fe12588b1edc7a4c05691fc5beaa7ad2`.
- TURN key `caper-voice-mvp`: `d487cddbbd5b033ceb9a601155e0d6d8`.

Credentials are server-only, outside Git. The orb preview uses a private mode-0600
environment file. They have **not** been installed into AWS production. No DNS,
Worker, database, or production deployment was created by this provisioning.
Keep this temporary test separate from any future production app/key.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `MEDIA_ENABLED` | `true` enables voice; absent/false disables it |
| `CF_SFU_APP_ID` | SFU app ID, not account ID |
| `CF_SFU_APP_SECRET` | SFU secret, server-only |
| `CF_TURN_KEY_ID` | TURN key ID |
| `CF_TURN_API_TOKEN` | TURN key secret for generating short-lived credentials |
| `MEDIA_BIND` | Default `0.0.0.0:3001` |
| `RUST_LOG` | Suggested `caper_api=info` |
| `MEDIA_API_URL` | Web-process-only local/orb adapter target |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional PlanetScale Postgres URL. When set, the API connects and applies `apps/api/migrations` on startup. Use a direct primary URL on port `5432` (`sslmode=verify-full`). Leave empty to boot without a database. |

Use `.env.example`; Rust does not auto-load dotenv files. Export a private env
file before `cargo run -p caper-api`. Run the web process with
`MEDIA_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001 npm run dev:web`. Remote browsers require HTTPS.
In an orb use supervised services and portal URLs, not direct sandbox host URLs.

Image CI builds `apps/api/Dockerfile` and publishes
`production/caper:api-<full-40-character-sha>` after merge to main via `api-image.yml`,
using the existing `production-caper-ecr-publisher` IAM role.
The Docker target and service name are `api` and `caper-api`, respectively.
This is the application control API, not a self-hosted audio relay. Publishing
does not roll it out. The image notification includes a green **Deploy Caper API**
button for that exact SHA and an **Open GitHub** fallback to
`deploy-caper-api.yml` in `joswayski/infrastructure`.
Deployment/Service/ExternalSecret are named `caper-api`; the container is `api`.
AWS Secrets Manager `production/apps/caper-api` supplies Kubernetes Secret
`caper-api-cloudflare`. Keep one API replica with `Recreate`, port 3001,
`/api/media` routing, and existing `MEDIA_*` / `CF_*` configuration names.
The active web Deployment/Service remains `caper` with two replicas: renaming it
to `caper-web` requires a separate reviewed rollout and SSM deployment-target update.

Web and API images publish independently. `api-image.yml` runs only when
`apps/api`, workspace Cargo files, or that workflow change. `aws-image.yml`
runs only when the website Docker context, `apps/web`, `shared`, npm workspace
manifests, or that workflow change. An API-only merge does not publish a website image or
send a **Deploy Caper web** notification, and a website-only merge does not
publish an API image. Future workers or other services should get their own
workflow and path allowlist instead of riding these two.

Outbound HTTPS to `rtc.live.cloudflare.com` is required for the Rust API. AWS
needs no public media UDP ports. Clients use SFU plus TURN UDP and TCP/TLS
fallback; browser-blocked TURN port 53 is filtered. `/api/media/status` reports
the feature flag; web `/api/health` is independent of provider availability.

## Limits and lifecycle

- 12 simultaneous people, one microphone publication each, 11 subscriptions.
- 30 joins/minute globally; 120 provider mutations/minute per participant;
  256 KiB request bodies. These are **not a spending cap or DDoS defense**.
- One-hour session/TURN lifetime; 45-second presence lease, sweep every five
  seconds. Background browser throttling can force a reconnect.
- Leave stops local capture immediately, invalidates the capability, force-closes
  SFU tracks/subscriptions, and revokes TURN credentials. Failed track cleanup has
  a bounded retry backlog; crashes/outages can prevent immediate revocation.
  Credentials remain bounded by expiry. No durable cleanup queue exists.
- Serialized negotiations and per-participant operation guards. Ambiguous provider
  creation is not blindly retried; the session is invalidated and cleaned up.
- Network failure triggers up to three rejoins retaining mute/deafen and device
  choice. Permission/device failures are visible. All microphone subscriptions
  are automatic. Deafen mutes playback, not forwarding/bandwidth.
- Mute disables the local track and detaches it from the sender. Opus is preferred;
  browser echo cancellation and gain control are requested. DTX is not guaranteed.
- Speaking indicators and diagnostics use browser stats where available, not
  billing records. Output selection requires `HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId`;
  otherwise use OS settings. Joining requires microphone permission.

## On-device noise suppression

DeepFilterNet3 balanced is the default microphone mode. Capture → browser echo cancellation
and gain control → 48 kHz mono AudioWorklet/WASM DeepFilterNet or RNNoise → MediaStream output
track → existing WebRTC Opus sender → Cloudflare SFU. The Rust control API, SFU
configuration, and TURN path do not change. No LiveKit dependency, denoising API,
license server, per-minute inference fee, or raw-audio upload is introduced.

The model and WASM (~24 MB combined) are vendored and loaded from Caper's own
`/audio/deepfilter-v1/` path only when enhanced capture is requested. They are
versioned/cacheable and included by the existing web build/Docker COPY stages.
License notices, source provenance, and checksums are in the adjacent README.
No new environment variables or infrastructure configuration are required.

### Comparing free filters

| Mode | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| DeepFilterNet balanced (default) | 20 dB attenuation limit, retaining about 10% original spectral amplitude. |
| DeepFilterNet gentle | 12 dB limit, retaining about 25% original amplitude; more voice **and noise** return. |
| DeepFilterNet strong | Original 40 dB limit, retaining about 1% original amplitude. |
| RNNoise | Independent lightweight 48 kHz neural model, 3.6 MB same-origin download. No VAD gating. |
| Browser suppression | Built-in baseline; implementation/support varies by browser/device. |
| Off | No requested noise suppression; AEC and automatic gain control still enabled. |

DeepFilter presets blend the enhanced and time-aligned original spectrum; they do
not retrain the model or change its speech decisions. Post-filter beta is explicitly
zero. Lower limits can soften artifacts but cannot guarantee recovery of clean speech
from loud AC. Neither model fixes clipping already introduced by microphone hardware,
gain control, or echo cancellation. Compare Off too before attributing all artifacts
to denoising. Use headphones for local monitoring: speaker feedback is not a fair
suppression test. Keep microphone position and gain fixed when comparing modes.

As of September 2026, [DeepFilterNet3](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet)
and [RNNoise](https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise) are practical free full-band options;
neither is universally best or demonstrated here to outperform Krisp. Newer research
such as [GTCRN](https://github.com/Xiaobin-Rong/gtcrn) is worth tracking, but its
16 kHz reference path and extra streaming integration are not an automatic upgrade
for natural full-band voice. These are specialist neural audio models, not LLMs.
RNNoise provenance/reproduction is in `apps/web/public/audio/rnnoise-v1/README.md`.
The shared adapter lives at `/audio/noise-v1/`; previously published immutable
DeepFilter assets are unchanged. Normal web deployment includes all new assets;
no operator configuration commands are required.

The selector is available before joining and during a call. Off disables noise
suppression, not echo cancellation. DeepFilter and RNNoise request browser suppression
off to avoid double denoising. The active status appears only after the worklet
acknowledges initialization. If loading/initialization fails, capture falls back
to browser suppression when supported, otherwise unsuppressed audio, with an
explicit status. A runtime processor error bypasses the worklet without replacing
or unmuting the outgoing track. This is failure recovery, not an assurance that
all CPU overload or audio artifacts can be detected automatically.

Device/mode changes replace the outgoing track and release the previous hardware
track and AudioContext. Reconnect retains the selected mode. Cancel/leave aborts
downloads and closes both capture and processed tracks; a late permission grant
is released. Mode is in memory for the page lifetime, not persisted to storage.
DeepFilter is not an echo canceller, voice gate, or guaranteed primary-speaker
isolation. It can affect laughter, music, whispers, and natural voice timbre.
The adapter adds 10 ms buffering **in addition to** model and system latency.

Alternative-engine validation, September 6, 2026:

- `npm test --workspace @caper/web`: 38 passing tests after rebasing onto the
  merged microphone-monitor PR #24, including real pinned
  RNNoise inference (>6 dB stationary-noise attenuation), engine/preset selection,
  and shared worklet frame ordering. `npm run check` passed.
- Microphone-monitor integration and web typecheck passed; no monitor API changes
  were needed. The monitor feature is provided by PR #24, not duplicated here.
- Generated-microphone Chromium check: balanced, gentle, strong and RNNoise
  reached active status; browser baseline honestly reported unavailable in this
  environment; Off worked. Switching during monitoring retained live/enabled local
  playback and ended the old track. Desktop and 390px layouts inspected. Room
  signaling/PeerConnection were mocked, not the audio processing.
- Built Nitro RNNoise WASM response: HTTP 200, `application/wasm`, immutable cache
  header and matching vendored SHA-256. Docker daemon unavailable.
- No physical AC/voice comparison, new live-SFU test, cross-platform desktop
  capture test, or sustained performance benchmark was performed for these modes.

Original DeepFilter integration validation, September 6, 2026:

- Actual pinned WASM/model inference in Node: finite, nonzero output and >6 dB
  attenuation on deterministic stationary noise (not a speech-quality benchmark).
- Mocked lifecycle tests: readiness, fallback, runtime bypass preserving mute,
  abort/late permission, disposal, and same-origin-only asset loading.
- Chromium with a generated microphone: real AudioContext/AudioWorklet/model;
  processed (not raw) track publication, enhanced/off switching while muted,
  and old capture/context disposal checked. Room signaling was mocked for UI
  verification; this is **not** a new live Cloudflare SFU acceptance result.
- Separate real Chromium WebRTC loopback: 9,646 bytes received, 183,360 decoded
  samples, nonzero audio energy, zero concealed samples in a four-second check;
  replacing the enhanced track with Off succeeded. This tests local Opus transport,
  not physical speech quality, sustained performance, or the Cloudflare network.
- Built Nitro app: real worklet reached active status; model HTTP download hash
  matched the vendored bytes with no Content-Encoding transformation. Docker
  daemon was unavailable; web build stages and built-server asset serving were
  validated directly, not via a container run.
- Desktop/mobile browser layouts inspected; physical microphones, headset and
  speakerphone echo, speech preservation, sustained CPU/gaming load, Firefox,
  Safari, and all Tauri webviews/native capture remain unvalidated.

Desktop direction: the existing Tauri shell has no working voice implementation.
This browser adapter is not a native desktop audio pipeline. The same model can
be used with upstream Rust `libDF`; native capture, echo cancellation, and feeding
processed PCM into the chosen native WebRTC sender still need implementation.
Do not transport continuous PCM through ordinary Tauri command/event IPC.

## Cost and acceptance

[Cloudflare SFU/TURN pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/sfu/pricing/)
was checked September 6, 2026: **outbound GB × $0.05**, ignoring credits/allowances.
The combined SFU/TURN path is not double-charged. AWS application costs are separate.
This is an unmoderated temporary test; anyone can consume capacity/bandwidth.

Automated tests cover ownership, expiry, limits, non-voice rejection, TURN
cleanup, provider errors, negotiations, permission/leave races, mute, deafen,
and the fixed-path adapter. These tests alone do not prove live media works.

Live Chromium test, September 6, 2026: two browser participants exchanged Opus
audio through the actual SFU (over 180 KB sent and received each, nonzero decoded
audio energy). One participant forced relay; selected ICE stats confirmed a
successful **TURN/TCP** connection. Mute detached the sender; deafen muted the
audio element; leave closed the PeerConnection, removed playback, and cleared
the participant from the other browser's roster. Input was a generated tone,
not a physical microphone. No SFU/signaling responses were mocked. This test
caught and fixed session creation incorrectly sending `{}` instead of no body.

Physical microphone/speaker quality, multiple networks, prolonged sessions,
mobile background behavior, Firefox/Safari, and Tauri remain separate checks.

Before wider testing, use physical browsers on two networks; verify audible
speech, device unplug/change, denial, repeated join/leave, restart, mute/deafen,
and a long session. Force relay in a test-only PeerConnection override and inspect
selected ICE stats, then test a restrictive network including TCP/TLS fallback.
Do not infer TURN success from ordinary Wi-Fi. Compare muted/speaking RTP deltas.

## Runbook

- Unavailable: inspect feature flag, `/health`, ingress routing, secret names,
  and outbound HTTPS. Never print credentials, SDP or raw media in logs.
- Silent: check microphone permission, mute/deafen, output selection and Play
  audio fallback, then incoming/outgoing RTP and selected ICE candidate stats.
- Stale roster: verify exactly one Rust API instance, snapshots and lease sweep.
- Provider cleanup failure: use private operator credentials to inspect/close
  tracks, never a public admin proxy. Disable new joins during provider outages.
- Rotation: create replacement app/key, update the private deployment secret,
  restart via the approved deployment path, verify two clients, then revoke old
  resources. Never put these secrets in browser bundles or desktop builds.
- Take down: disable `MEDIA_ENABLED` and restart the API (GitOps in production;
  stop the supervised media service for the orb). Revoke the temporary SFU app
  and TURN key after testing. The website can remain up.
